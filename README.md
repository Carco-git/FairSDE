## Datasets

We don't provide datasets download here since some of them are licensed.

| Dataset | Task | Sensitive Attributes |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| MIMIC-CXR | Chest X-ray diagnosis | Race, Gender |
| HAM10000 | Skin lesion classification | Gender, Age |
| Harvard-GF | Glaucoma detection | Race, Gender |
| CelebA | Face attributes (”straight hair” and ”smiling”) | Gender |
| UTKFace | Ethnicity/Gender prediction | Gender, Ethnicity |

## Start

### 1. Prepare Data

Download datasets from their original websites and follow the comments in ```FairSDE/dataset.py```

### 2. Training

Example:

```bash
python train.py \
    --dataset ham \  # Dataset name (ham, mimiccxr, celeba, utk, eye)
    --data_path ./data \   #Path to data directory
    --lr 0.05 \  # Learning rate, tune for each dataset and method
    --epochs 60 \ 
    --bs 256 \
    --lambda1 0.1 \  # L_disc
    --lambda2 1 \  # L_virt
    --lambda3 1 \  # L_div
    --seed 7 \
    --sa race
```
